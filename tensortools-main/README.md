TensorTools is a bare bones Python package for fitting and visualizing [canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_rank_decomposition) of higher-order data arrays. I originally developed this library for applications in neuroscience ([Williams et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.015)), but the code could be helpful in other domains.

Installation
------------

From the command line run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ahwillia/tensortools
```

(You will need to have `git` installed for this command to work.)

Alternatively you can download the source code and install locally by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/ahwillia/tensortools
cd tensortools
pip install -e .
```

Quick Start
------------

Here's how to perform a parameter sweep over 1 - 9 components, and plot the reconstruction error and similarity diagnostics as a function of the model rank (these diagnostics are described in [Williams et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.015)). The snippet also uses `plot_factors(...)` to plot the factors extracted by one of the models in the ensemble.

The method `"ncp_hals"` fits a nonnegative tensor decomposition, other methods are `"ncp_bcd"` (also nonnegative) and `"cp_als"` (unconstrained decomposition). See the [`tensortools/optimize/`](/tensortools/optimize) folder for the implementation of these algorithms.


```python
import tensortools as tt

data = # ... specify a numpy array holding the tensor you wish to fit

# Fit an ensemble of models, 4 random replicates / optimization runs per model rank
ensemble = tt.Ensemble(fit_method="ncp_hals")
ensemble.fit(data, ranks=range(1, 9), replicates=4)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
tt.plot_objective(ensemble, ax=axes[0])   # plot reconstruction error as a function of num components.
tt.plot_similarity(ensemble, ax=axes[1])  # plot model similarity as a function of num components.
fig.tight_layout()

# Plot the low-d factors for an example model, e.g. rank-2, first optimization run / replicate.
num_components = 2
replicate = 0
tt.plot_factors(ensemble.factors(num_components)[replicate])  # plot the low-d factors

plt.show()
```

Time-Shifted Tensor Decompositions
----------------------------------

This repo contains a module `tensortools.cpwarp` which allows for *time-shifted tensor decompositions* of 3d-arrays. The motivation behind this model and some of its implementaional details are laid out in the following set of notes.

>  Alex H. Williams (2020). [Combining tensor decomposition and time warping models for multi-neuronal spike train analysis](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.974014). *bioRxiv*. 2020.03.02.974014

A very similar model was previously proposed by [MÃ¸rup et al. (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.05.062). Also see [Sorokin et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976688) for an application of this model to neural data.
To fit this model, check out the script in [`examples/shift_cpd.py`](./examples/shift_cpd.py), which should reproduce Figure 4 from the [Williams (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.974014) paper.

The important function to call is `fit_shifted_cp()`, like below:

```python
fit_shifted_cp(
    data,
    rank,
    boundary="wrap",
    n_restarts=5,
    max_shift_axis0=0.1,
    max_shift_axis1=None,
    min_iter=10,
    max_iter=100,
    u_nonneg=True,
    v_nonneg=True,
    tol=1e-4,
    patience=5,
    mask=None,
)

"""
Fits a time-shifted CP decomposition to 3d-array `data`. The model parameters
are three factor matrices {u, v, w} and two sets of shift parameters {u_s, v_s}.

u.shape == (rank, data.shape[0])
v.shape == (rank, data.shape[1])
w.shape == (rank, data.shape[2])
u_s.shape == (rank, data.shape[0])
v_s.shape == (rank, data.shape[1])

The element `data[i, j, k]` is approximated by:

  sum_r ( u[r, i] * v[r, j] * w[r, t + u_s[r, i] + v_s[r, i]] )

Note that if the shift parameters are zero (u_s == v_s == 0), this is the typical
CP tensor decomposition.

Parameters
----------
data : ndarray
  Data tensor.
rank : int
  Number of components.
init_u : ndarray or None
  Initial guess for factor matrix `u`.
init_v : ndarray or None
  Initial guess for factor matrix `v`.
init_w : ndarray or None
  Initial guess for factor matrix `w`.
max_shift_axis0 : float or None
  Maximum absolute value for u_s, expressed
  as a fraction on the interval (0, 0.5].
  If None, then all u_s shifts are set to zero.
max_shift_axis1 : float
  Maximum absolute value for v_s, expressed
  as a fraction on the interval (0, 0.5].
  If None, then all v_s shifts are set to zero.
u_nonneg : bool
  If True, the factor matrix u is constrained
  to be nonnegative.
v_nonneg : bool
  If True, the factor matrix v is constrained
  to be nonnegative.
boundary : str
  If equal to "wrap" the shifting along axis=2
  has a periodic boundary condition. Otherwise
  the behavior is similar to "edge" mode in the
  numpy.pad() function.
min_iter : int
  Minimum number of iterations before stopping.
max_iter : int
  Maximum number of iterations before giving up.
tol : float
  Convergence tolerance
patience : int
  Number of iterations to wait between convergence
  checks.
mask : ndarray of booleans or None
  Specifies missing data, and can be used for
  cross-validation.
